<!-- Getting Started -->
## 	:toolbox: Getting Started

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### :bangbang: Prerequisites

You must have a valid API key for TVDB.

<!-- Installation -->
### :gear: Installation

Download the binary from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/seancallaway/mediamover/releases).

We'll have better installation options in the future.

<!-- Usage -->
## :eyes: Usage

After installing create a `config.ini` file in the following format:

```ini
api_key = <YOUR_TVDB_API_KEY>
tv_root = <The Path to Store Your TV Show Files>
movie_root = <The Path to Store Your Movie Files>
```

After that's created and the values are set properly, you can load your movies or shows.
